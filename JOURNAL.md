## 10/24/2025 8 PM - Opening Words  

hiii!

i've been looking at stream decks for a while and i've noticed that stream decks are expensive. like, they're $130 for a few keys! so, i went onto this and thought "lets make my own!". i want to learn some hardware things and i think this is a good idea :)

firstly, i'm very new to the whole hardware thing so theres going to be a lot of research and probably some AI assistance with it. i know of esp boards, but more research will need to be done on what boards i can get, and what would suit.

i want the keys to be little oled screens so we can have custom icons, and id also like for there to be a little oled panel and knob to control things such as volume levels. 

a companion app is also needed. maybe we could stick a button on the deck to open the app for us.

id like windows compatibility first but we should be able to get linux and macos as well quite easily. 

attached are some reference images and an idea for the layout of the deck. note it will probably change depending on the budget.

## 10/24/2025 9 PM - PCB Research  

hey again!!!

i'm writing this whilst doing my research so there may be some weird thought shifts and questions here that will confuse you. 

so, firstly: i've googled esp32 boards. these have wifi and bluetooth built-in. now i like this idea for wireless connectivity to a computer, however my pc doesn't have an in-built bluetooth thing. this means i'll need a USB connector. however, bluetooth is still a nice option for those that may want to build this themselves.

now, i've looked at alternatives to an esp32 to see pricing and sizing. i've seen the arduino nano R4. i'm avoiding raspberry pi's due to their size. they're quite bulky and honestly (imo) expensive. 
i've never done anything like this before so i'm strongly wondering how we can connect an arduino to the oled keys. 

[arduino nano r4](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIyOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6ecef728b86376769505e41fa8d782bf39d15cd6/ABX00142_04.box_1000x750.webp)

this is the arduino nano r4's specs. got some decent specs, but esp32's are allegedly quicker. performance shouldnt be an issue for a keypad made of oled screens though. the arduino comes at around 12 gpb, and an esp32 wroom-32 is 10 gbp. i also want usb a or usb c connectivity. NOT micro-usb, ruling raspberry pi's out again.

![esp 32 wroom-32](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a33929e7cd1780ce04a09b7153c30a19aee5566e/51PnDDJHYzL._AC_SL1001_.jpg)

i might just go for the esp32, as they aren't that expensive and are generally quite commonly used. 

after some more research i'm probably going for the esp32 as theyre more powerful (dual core 240mhz over 48mhz) and have more i/o pins. the i/o pins shouldnt matter as we'll have more than enough for 10 keys, a screen and knob - but still. 

now for the next journal, i'm going to look into oled keys. i have even less of an idea of what i'm doing, but here we go.
  

## 10/25/2025 12 AM - oled research  

okay, oled research now.

i need an oled screen to show things at the top of the deck and oled screens for the keys themselves.

firstly, the keys. i think they're more important than the top screen. now, the stream deck itself uses 72x72 lcd keys, so lets see any oled alternatives that we can use. 

now, i admit - i have used some AI for this to quickly search some options. it's difficult to find decent options for what i want. however, the AI has returned an SSD1306 oled display. 

putting this into google has returned a ![I2C Oled display](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/tesla-landing/index.html?scenario=c_ppc_item_bridge&productId=1005006782987637&_immersiveMode=true&withMainCard=true&src=google&aff_platform=true&isdl=y) which would look more suitable for the screen at the top of the deck. however, i'm unsure whether it'd be good or not as it is quite small. keeping this here for future ref.

i haven't actually done any sizing yet, however we don't want the device to be too large obviously. a 1.3" oled MAYYY(?) be okay for each key. 

UPDATE: okay, after a little bit more research, there aren't actually many (if any) ways to get OLED keys that will support colour. i am NOT inventing it either ðŸ˜‚. we might have to go for an LCD display unfortunately for each key, however OLED may be possible for the top display.

now, some research has shown me ![this](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--cd3c7940ee4a3f840cde920f42b38ab5338cbb5a/61hJqm3G3tL._AC_SL1200_.jpg)
) which is a 1.3" lcd screen. i managed to find ![these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DSDPWM3F/ref=twister_B0DSDPB4MS?_encoding=UTF8&th=1) on amazon for a switch. however, lcds are quite fragile and will end up breaking.

ANOTHER UPDATE: 

I've just started work in KiCad and come across the SW_E3_SA3624's. Now, I don't really know whether these will do us any good, but lets wing it. firstly, the esp board we're using outputs 3.3v. these switches use 5v. so, we need level shifters to fix this for us and add some safety. TXS0108E chips are what i've noticed to work okay, they're bi-directional and cheap. we'd need 2 to handle all 10 keys but it's fine. i'm also adding some capacitors to make it a little bit nicer and more responsive.

below is all the current components. i'll see how we get along :)

## 10/25/2025 4 PM - some updates!  

okay, its been a bit. i've slept and more research. firstly, i'm changing the esp32 wroom to the esp32 c3 supermini. this is because we need a usb C port, which isnt present on the esp32 wroom.

secondly, i've had a gander at e3 keys - the original key that we chose was a 3624 from this place. and when i tried to look at their datasheet, it wasn't present. e3 keys has said this product is discontinued (which is most likely why the datasheet isnt available!)

so, we need a replacement.

introducing the ![TE6432!](https://lcd-keys.com/files/TE6432_v1.0en.pdf) this is a 64x32 switch with many backlight colours and is widely used in production on things ![such as this :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--t8OuQtinE) 

i'll have to contact e3 to order these switches, as they unfortunately are not available publicly so pricing is unavailable. before pricing is figured out, i'll try and make this project with those switches. we might be getting places :)
