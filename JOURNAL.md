hiii!

i've been looking at stream decks for a while and i've noticed that stream decks are expensive. like, they're $130 for a few keys! so, i went onto this and thought "lets make my own!". i want to learn some hardware things and i think this is a good idea :)

firstly, i'm very new to the whole hardware thing so theres going to be a lot of research and probably some AI assistance with it. i know of esp boards, but more research will need to be done on what boards i can get, and what would suit.

i want the keys to be little oled screens so we can have custom icons, and id also like for there to be a little oled panel and knob to control things such as volume levels. 

a companion app is also needed. maybe we could stick a button on the deck to open the app for us.

id like windows compatibility first but we should be able to get linux and macos as well quite easily. 

attached are some reference images and an idea for the layout of the deck. note it will probably change depending on the budget.

## 10/24/2025 9 PM - PCB Research  

hey again!!!

i'm writing this whilst doing my research so there may be some weird thought shifts and questions here that will confuse you. 

so, firstly: i've googled esp32 boards. these have wifi and bluetooth built-in. now i like this idea for wireless connectivity to a computer, however my pc doesn't have an in-built bluetooth thing. this means i'll need a USB connector. however, bluetooth is still a nice option for those that may want to build this themselves.

now, i've looked at alternatives to an esp32 to see pricing and sizing. i've seen the arduino nano R4. i'm avoiding raspberry pi's due to their size. they're quite bulky and honestly (imo) expensive. 
i've never done anything like this before so i'm strongly wondering how we can connect an arduino to the oled keys. 

[arduino nano r4](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIyOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6ecef728b86376769505e41fa8d782bf39d15cd6/ABX00142_04.box_1000x750.webp)

this is the arduino nano r4's specs. got some decent specs, but esp32's are allegedly quicker. performance shouldnt be an issue for a keypad made of oled screens though. the arduino comes at around 12 gpb, and an esp32 wroom-32 is 10 gbp. i also want usb a or usb c connectivity. NOT micro-usb, ruling raspberry pi's out again.

![esp 32 wroom-32](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a33929e7cd1780ce04a09b7153c30a19aee5566e/51PnDDJHYzL._AC_SL1001_.jpg)

i might just go for the esp32, as they aren't that expensive and are generally quite commonly used. 

after some more research i'm probably going for the esp32 as theyre more powerful (dual core 240mhz over 48mhz) and have more i/o pins. the i/o pins shouldnt matter as we'll have more than enough for 10 keys, a screen and knob - but still. 

now for the next journal, i'm going to look into oled keys. i have even less of an idea of what i'm doing, but here we go.
