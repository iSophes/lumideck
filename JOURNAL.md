## 10/24/2025 - Opening Words  

hiii!

i've been looking at stream decks for a while and i've noticed that stream decks are expensive. like, they're $130 for a few keys! so, i went onto this and thought "lets make my own!". i want to learn some hardware things and i think this is a good idea :)

firstly, i'm very new to the whole hardware thing so theres going to be a lot of research and probably some AI assistance with it. i know of esp boards, but more research will need to be done on what boards i can get, and what would suit.

i want the keys to be little oled screens so we can have custom icons, and id also like for there to be a little oled panel and knob to control things such as volume levels. 

a companion app is also needed. maybe we could stick a button on the deck to open the app for us.

id like windows compatibility first but we should be able to get linux and macos as well quite easily. 

attached are some reference images and an idea for the layout of the deck. note it will probably change depending on the budget.
